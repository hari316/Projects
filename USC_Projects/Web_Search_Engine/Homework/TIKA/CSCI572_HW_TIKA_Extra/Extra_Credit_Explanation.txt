Using Levenshtein Distance Algorithm

In Tika Assignment if none of the keyword list matches with the given file then we try to match the keyword(only long
phrases) in file using levenshtein distance considering threshold value of 3.
We avoid keyoword of length less than 5 as this may provide false hit for our assumed threshold value.

Eg: Disc in Discuss is a match according to Livenstein Distance Algorithm which we dont want, hence we consider
long keyword lengths like "Extraterrestrial" which can give a match for "Extra Terrestrial", "extraterritorial",
"spaces" for "Spaceship" or Fly Object for Flying Object, which wont be possible using regular expression.

The result is we get 294 files found compared to out previous result of 212 files.

Observation: 
 - Increase in Keyword "extraterrestrial" from 5 to 30
 - Increase in Keyword "spaceship" from 3 to 133
 - Increase in Keyword "spacecraft" from 6 to 11

Some of the New files found are:
